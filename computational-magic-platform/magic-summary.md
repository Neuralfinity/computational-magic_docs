# Magic-Summary

If you are already familiar with using GraphQL, feel free to just follow the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart).
Otherwise, use the instructions on this page to get started. 

# Getting Started

## Obtaining an API Key

We have two options: you can either [Contact Us](https://www.neuralfinity.com/#contact) to get an API Key directly from us for a fee to get usage within an agreed envelope. A self service portal is planned for relase at a later date. 

The second option is to use Magic-Summary via the [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/neuralfinity1-neuralfinity-default/api/magicsummary/) service. 

## Finding Code Samples

Right now, we have code samples in [Javascript](./examples/javascript) and [Python](./examples/python) that you can use within your code freely. 

There are new languages and packages added over time, so please [contact us](https://www.neuralfinity.com/#contact) if you are missing your language or GraphQL client package, so we can prioritise adding it, or [contribute](/contribute) to the documentation. 

## Starter Projects 

Starter projects are not yet ready, but will be inlcuded in the ["Code Samples" Repository](https://github.com/Neuralfinity/computational-magic_code-samples) on Github soon.
