# Why Contribute? 
You may notice some parts of the documentation may not answer your question in a satisfying manner, or may not even address it at all. In this case, you may want to support the community by adding to it. 

Along with the V1 final release, Computational Magic will be released under a yet to be determined open source licnece, but will be dual licenced so that all commerical scenarios are possible for customers. 

From that moment, this section will also be updated to contain instruction on how to contribute to Computational Magic itself, as well as its various components. 

# How to Contribute

You can see a Github link above each page that links to the page's Github file. You can submit pullrequests for documentation content there, and thus contribute to better documentation.
