# Roadmap 

At this time Computational Magic is still in an early beta version, which means many features are planned but not yet implemented. 

## Major features
- Self service portal to create API keys, monitor API calls etc

## Models currently in development 
- Image-Text extraction
    - A new model to find and extract text from image data, from anything like road signs, photos, scans etc; 
    - (in internal testing, release planned for Q3 2022)
- Ichograph:
    - A transformer based, high accuracy automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that can transcribe spoken words to text
    - (currently in internal testing)
- Text to Speech
    - Want your app to speak, read text to the user or even build a full virtual assistant? We want to make naturally sounding voices more accessible with a new text to speech model. 
    - (currently in development)
- Transformer Image Classification Model 
    - Model to classify images, trained with a broad dataset to be able to perform many domain independent image recognition tasks (some industry / domain specific versions are also planned)
    - (in planning phase)
- Transformer many-to-many language Translation 
    - A transformer based model that can translate multiple languages between each other without intermediary. Right now in scope are German, English, Russian, French, Spanish and Italian, but a lot more are planned to be added. Work on this is still early, so we can't give a planned release date yet.
