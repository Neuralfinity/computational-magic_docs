# Security Considerations 

We strongly recommend not exposing your keys; Ideally, you want to access the Computational Magic API from your backend and pass the data that way to your frontend. If you need help and/or advice, you can always reach out. 

Same goes for any data processing agreement that you may need from us, just [drop us a message](https://www.neuralfinity.com/#contact) and we can sort it out for you.
