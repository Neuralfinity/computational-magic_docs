# Rapid-API
To make Computational Magic easy to use for existing Rapid-API users and to enable fast signup and metered usage before we complete implementing the full feature set of the Computational Magic platform, some models are also available through Rapid-API. Whilst the core GraphQL syntax is the same, usage differs with different API endpoints as well as using a different authentication mechanism and endpoint. 

Other options to consume Computational Magic are through our own [Computational Magic Platform](/computational-magic-platform) (which does not support self service yet) and on-premise deployment.
