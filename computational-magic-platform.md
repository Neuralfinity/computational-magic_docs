# Computational Magic Platform 
There are different ways you can consume the Computational Magic API: through our own hosted solution (Computational Magic Platform), through [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/neuralfinity1-neuralfinity-default/api/magicsummary/) as well as an on premise deployment. 

To use Computational Magic via the Computational Magic Platform, you will need an API key, which you can obtain by sending a message to the team here: [Contact Us](https://www.neuralfinity.com/#contact) or by sending an [email](mailto:hello@neuralfinity.com). 

If you want to use the on-premise deployment, please use the same channel as above.
